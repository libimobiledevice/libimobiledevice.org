1.1 This website and all other related websites on which a link to these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) is displayed, and the libimobiledevice content and libimobiledevice services available on or through any of the foregoing (collectively, our “Service”) are provided to you by libimobiledevice, Inc., located at 318 Cambridge Avenue, P.O. Box 61180 Palo Alto, CA 94306, United States (“libimobiledevice”). These Terms govern all access and use of the Service.

1.2 All use of the Service is subject to acceptance of these Terms. By accessing or using the Service, or any content or services provided on the Service, you are agreeing to these Terms. If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of an entity, such as your employer or the company you work for, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind, and do hereby bind, that entity to these Terms. You may not use the Service if you are a person barred from using the Service under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Service, or international laws or treaties. You may not use the Service if you are or represent an entity that is listed on any U.S. Government Denied Party/Person List. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Service is not intended for children under 13. IF YOU ARE 13 OR OLDER BUT UNDER THE AGE OF 18, OR THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY WHERE YOU RESIDE IF THAT JURISDICTION HAS AN OLDER AGE OF MAJORITY, THEN YOU AGREE TO REVIEW THE TERMS WITH YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH YOU AND YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS.

2.6 Vulnerability Reporting Service. When you use this service, libimobiledevice’s service will scan the images that you specify, which may be based upon code you authored, or code of others, and may generate vulnerability reports or information. You understand that any reports or other information that you receive from libimobiledevice about possible vulnerabilities are not guaranteed to be comprehensive, and there can be no assurance that every fault or vulnerability is discovered in a particular image. You agree that libimobiledevice’s service should not be used as the basis to deploy systems that must be hardened or highly secure, or involve mission-critical business operations, the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, important communication systems, medical devices, air traffic control devices, real time control systems or other situations in which an inaccuracy or error in a report or in the service could lead to death, personal injury, or physical property or environmental damage.

Accounts using business names and/or logos that may be considered misleading to others may be permanently suspended. We also reserve the right to reclaim usernames using libimobiledevice trademarks or usernames that violate the libimobiledevice Trademark Guidelines (the “Trademark Guidelines”), which are hereby incorporated into these Terms by reference.

You may opt out of granting libimobiledevice the foregoing license, or require that you and libimobiledevice execute a separate license agreement therefor, by providing written notice to libimobiledevice within five (5) calendar days of the date you enter into these Terms.

4.3 Username Squatting. You may not and may not allow any third party to engage in username squatting. Accounts that are inactive for more than six months may be terminated at our discretion and without further notice.

4.4 Selling Usernames. You may not and may not allow any third party to buy or sell usernames.

5. Fees

5.1 Subject to the Terms, the Service is provided to you without charge up to certain limits. Usage over this limit may require you to purchase additional resources or services. The pricing for additional resources and services can be found on this website.

5.2 For all purchased resources and services, including with limitation any purchased Applications (as defined in Section 9), libimobiledevice will charge your credit card on a monthly basis or at the interval indicated in libimobiledevice fees and payment policies, if different. libimobiledevice may change its fees and payment policies by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. Late payments will bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). All fees are non-refundable (except as expressly set forth in Section 11.3) and exclusive of applicable taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees libimobiledevice incurs collecting late amounts. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to libimobiledevice may be shared by libimobiledevice with companies who work on libimobiledevice's behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to libimobiledevice and servicing your account. libimobiledevice may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. libimobiledevice shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. libimobiledevice reserves the right to disable your access to the Service for any late payments. Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.

6. User Content

6.1 The Service allows you and other users to submit, post, transmit, and share content with other users, which may include, without limitation, data files, text, articles, documents, computer software or code, music, images, audiovisual works, informational materials and any user comments submitted by you and other users on or through the Service (collectively, “User Content”). For the avoidance of doubt, User Content shall not include Applications (as defined in Section 9). You retain all your ownership rights in your User Content. libimobiledevice simply displays or makes the User Content available to users of the Service and does not otherwise control the content thereof. libimobiledevice does not guarantee any accuracy or confidentiality with respect to any information contained in any User Content, and strongly recommends that you think carefully about what you transmit, submit or post to or through the Service. You understand that all information contained in User Content is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such User Content originated. This means that you, and not libimobiledevice, are entirely responsible for all User Content that you upload, post, transmit, or otherwise make available through the Service, as well as for any actions taken by libimobiledevice or other users as a result of such User Content.

6.2 libimobiledevice intends to, but does not guarantee that it will, display or make any User Content available on or through the Service, and libimobiledevice reserves the right to refuse to allow any User Content on the Service, or to edit or remove any User Content at any time with or without prior notice, if libimobiledevice reasonably believes that you or your User Content are in violation of these Terms or otherwise disrupt or threaten the operation of the Service. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, libimobiledevice complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and will remove User Content from the Service upon receipt of a compliant takedown notice (see Section 16 below). You agree to immediately take down any User Content that violates the Terms, including pursuant to a take-down request from libimobiledevice. In the event that you elect not to comply with a request from libimobiledevice to take down certain User Content, libimobiledevice reserves the right to directly take down such User Content, or to suspend or terminate your use of the Service.

6.3 By uploading or submitting your User Content through the Service, you hereby grant libimobiledevice and its affiliates and partners (collectively, the “libimobiledevice Licensees”) a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free license to reproduce (including by making mechanical reproductions), reformat, distribute, publicly display, and publicly perform your User Content in connection with providing you and other users with the services, features and functionalities available on or through the Service; provided, that for any User Content that is subject to an open source license, libimobiledevice’s rights shall be limited to the rights granted under the applicable open source license.

6.4 The Service allows you to specify or upload the terms under which other users of the Service will be licensed to use your User Content. If you do not specify or upload such license terms with respect to any User Content, you hereby grant to any other users of the Service, a non-exclusive license to access, download, use, modify or otherwise exploit such part of your User Content for any personal or business purposes.

6.5 You are solely responsible for your own User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing them. In connection with User Content, you affirm, represent, and warrant that: (i) you either own your User Content or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to grant the rights and licenses granted in these Terms, and (ii) the libimobiledevice Licensee’s exercise of the license rights set forth in this Section 6, does not and will not require obtaining a license from or paying any fees and/or royalties by libimobiledevice to any third party for the exercise of any rights granted in these Terms. However, the foregoing shall not be deemed a warranty by you of non-infringement of any third party patent rights.

6.6 You understand that libimobiledevice may scan User Content at any time to check for potential security vulnerabilities and other issues. libimobiledevice may request that you immediately remedy any issue it discovers in your User Content and retains the right to remove any User Content at any time without notice for any valid business or technical reasons, such as if security vulnerabilities are identified in such User Content.

6.7 You understand that User Content made available on or through the Service comes from a variety of sources and that libimobiledevice does not endorse and is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such User Content. You understand that libimobiledevice cannot, and does not, review all User Content and does not endorse any User Content. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, misleading, infringing, or otherwise objectionable. You agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against libimobiledevice with respect thereto. IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH SAYS: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”

6.8 You agree that libimobiledevice has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any User Content and other communications maintained on or transmitted through use of the Service. You further acknowledge that you are solely responsible for securing and backing up any User Content or other communication you upload or transmit to or through the Service.

7. Proprietary Rights

You acknowledge and agree that libimobiledevice (or libimobiledevice’s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Service. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, systems, methods, information, computer code, software, services, “look and feel”, organization, compilation of the content, code, data, and all other elements of the Service (collectively, the “libimobiledevice Materials”) are protected by United States copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, and all other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights, and applicable laws. Except for any User Content owned and/or posted by you or other users, all libimobiledevice Materials are the copyrighted property of libimobiledevice or its licensors. Furthermore, all trademarks, service marks, and trade names contained in the libimobiledevice Materials are proprietary to libimobiledevice or its licensors. Except as expressly set forth herein, your use of the Service does not grant to you ownership of or any other rights with respect to any content, code, data, user comments or other materials that you may access on or through the Service. libimobiledevice reserves all rights to the libimobiledevice Materials not expressly granted in the Terms

8. Feedback

You may choose to or libimobiledevice may invite you to submit comments, bug reports, ideas or other feedback about the Service, including without limitation about how to improve the Service or any other libimobiledevice products ("Feedback"). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that libimobiledevice is free to use such Feedback at its discretion and without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose such Feedback to third parties on a non-confidential basis or otherwise. You hereby grant libimobiledevice a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive license under all rights necessary to incorporate and use your Feedback for any purpose.

9. Third-Party Store

9.1 libimobiledevice may make available additional applications and services offered by its third-party partners through its Store ("Application(s)"). You acknowledge that your use of Applications may be subject to additional fees. You further acknowledge that your use of any Applications may be subject to a separate agreement between you and the third party licensor of that Application ("the Application Provider"), and that libimobiledevice shall not be a party to such separate agreement between you and the Application Provider. The Application Provider of each Application, and not libimobiledevice, is solely responsible for that Application, the content therein, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Application or the use of that Application. libimobiledevice does not endorse and is not responsible for the accuracy, functionality, usefulness, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such Applications. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the foregoing, libimobiledevice and its affiliates are third party beneficiaries of the agreement between you and the Application Provider for each Application, and that libimobiledevice will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce such agreement against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.

9.2 By subscribing to or purchasing an Application, you grant libimobiledevice permission to share your User Content, and user information with the Application Provider as necessary in order to provide you the Application.

If libimobiledevice terminates these Terms or your access or use of the Service due to your breach of these Terms or any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity, then termination of these Terms shall be in addition to any other remedies libimobiledevice may have at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event of any termination by libimobiledevice other than due to your breach of these Terms, libimobiledevice will reimburse to you any fees you have prepaid for resources and services purchased hereunder, prorated to the date of such termination.

11.4 Upon any termination or expiration of these Terms, whether by you or libimobiledevice, ANY INFORMATION (INCLUDING USER CONTENT) THAT YOU HAVE POSTED OR SUBMITTED ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE OR THAT WHICH IS RELATED TO YOUR ACCOUNT MAY NO LONGER BE ACCESSED BY YOU and libimobiledevice will have no obligation to maintain any such information in its databases or to forward any such information to you or any third party. You are solely responsible for retrieving your User Content from the Service prior to termination of your account for any reason, provided that if we terminate your account, we will provide you a reasonable opportunity to retrieve your User Content.

DOCKER WOULD NOTE BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE TO YOU WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.

IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH SAYS: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”

17. External Sites

17.1 The Service may include hyperlinks to other web sites or resources (collectively, “External Sites”) solely as a convenience to its users. libimobiledevice has no control over any External Sites which are provided by companies or persons other than libimobiledevice.

17.3 You acknowledge and agree that libimobiledevice is not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred as a result of the availability of the External Sites, or as a result of any reliance placed by you on the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or available from, the External Sites.

18. Changes to the Terms

libimobiledevice may make changes to the Terms from time to time. When such changes are made, libimobiledevice will make the updated Terms available on or through the Service. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. Unless otherwise agreed to between you and libimobiledevice in writing, your continued use of the Service after such changes have been published on or through the Service shall constitute your binding acceptance of such changes. Unless otherwise agreed to between you and libimobiledevice in writing, in the event that such changes materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder such amended Terms will automatically be effective upon the earlier of (i) your continued use of the Service with actual knowledge of such modifications, or (ii) 30 days from the date such modified Terms are made available on or through the Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the resolution of any dispute that arises between you and libimobiledevice will be governed by the Terms in effect at the time such dispute arose.

19. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

19.1 Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and libimobiledevice in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and libimobiledevice agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND DOCKER ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

19.2 Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 19.1, we both agree that nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

19.3 Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and libimobiledevice will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting libimobiledevice.

19.4 Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or if we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). libimobiledevice’s address for Notice is: libimobiledevice, Inc., 318 Cambridge Ave, P.O. Box 61180, Palo Alto, CA 94306. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or libimobiledevice may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or libimobiledevice must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, libimobiledevice will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by libimobiledevice in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.

19.5 Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, libimobiledevice will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, CA, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse libimobiledevice for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

19.6 No Class Actions. YOU AND libimobiledevice AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and libimobiledevice agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

19.7 Modifications. If libimobiledevice makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to libimobiledevice's address for Notice), you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to libimobiledevice's address for Notice, in which case your account with libimobiledevice will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject will survive.

19.8 Enforceability. If Section 19.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 20.7 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

20.9 Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, libimobiledevice may assign the entirety of its rights and obligations under these Terms, without your consent, to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of these Terms will be void
